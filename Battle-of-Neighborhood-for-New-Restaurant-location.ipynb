    "# Business Problem\n",
    "In my report I'm going to focus on problems one might face while opening a new restaurant. Well there are many factors to be considered to open a small or big level business. For example say Grace wants to open an Indian restaurant, first and foremost important point to decide is the location for her new restaurant. On what basis can Grace decide her restaurant's location? Does Grace want to rent the place or can she afford to buy it? While selecting the place there are key points to consider like she needs to check out how many Indian restaurants are there in that specific location? If incase there are already two Indian restaurants which have good ratings, will it be risky to open new one near these restaurants? What all factors will help Grace to run her business above average? (Out of scope for this project: Budget for Kitchen tools, restaurant furniture and decorations,hire new chef's and waiters, budget everybody's salary. Decide on Menu details, restaurant advertisment, publish dicount coupons, restaurant website.)"

    "# Discussion\n",
    "Let's discuss the above mentioned problem statements. Firstly Grace needs to choose a suitable location for her restaurant. Let's say Grace wants to open a new Indian Restaurant in San Francisco. San Francisco is a famous tourist place, and also its in silicon valley, because of that real estate is very costly. So assuming that Grace wants to rent a place for her new restaurant. And now she needs to figure out how many restaurants are there in say neighborhood A, B, C,etc. If there are more than two Indian restaurants in a neighborhood then that would be a great risk to open new restaurant of same cuisine in that neighborhood. Selecting a place where there is less or no restaurant would be of great choice, considering the rent of neighborhood too. Why I'm emphasing that there should be less restaurants is, so that Grace will face less competition with same cuisine restaurants. She needs to look for a place where many people frequently visit so that her business is above average. Places like Downtown, Movie theatre, Malls & Gas stations would help her business running. Restaurants ratings, checkin of customers might help in deciding location crowd. I would also suggest that Grace should check for opening and closing timings of other restaurants. She may try opening her place 30 mins before other restaurants open up and close 30 mins or 1 hour later the other restaurants, this might help to get more customers."

    "# Data Description\n",
    "As Grace is planning to open a restaurant in San Francisco, and assuming that she is going to rent a place. So first I took the rent dataset from (https://web.archive.org/web/20180822060556/https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ca/san-francisco/ , https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) according to neighborhood wise, so that it's easy for us to check the rent data neighborhood wise. In this dataset I couldn't get all neighborhoods rent information. So I managed to use only those information which I could get from the website. I have cleaned the dataset and I'm going to compare the rent data of year 2018. Because for this project we just need to analyse the current rent range. Since from the webpages I didn't get all neighborhood's rent data, I planned to test only for the data I have retrieved."

    "I'm going to use a formula to find which neighborhood is good to open a new restaurant. Before coming up with a formula, I was wondering what all attributes/factors can we consider because it's really unfair to compare data of 10 years old restaurant with 1 year old restaurant. Like for example, the checkin count of 10 years old restaurant will be more compared to a 1 year old or 6 months old restaurant. And also after analysing data I found that in many restaurants checkin count is zero. I thought checkin count would be really be helpful to figureout the number of crowd visiting a particular neighborhood, but because of data discrepancy I avoided it. Then I conclued that every restaurant would definitely have ratings. Even if 100 customers have visited a 1 year old restaurant, the rating will be out of 5 stars, and same goes for a 10year old restaurant.\n"

The restaurant details can be retrieved using search endpoint of foursquare location. For our project we need only Indian restaurant data, and in search endpoint there is a attribute called category id, i.e for each category(like Indian or Italian or Mexican Restaurant) foursquare has a defined categoryid which will help us to get the desired data. In this search response, we'll retrieve the venue id of all the Indian venues. And then pass this venue id's through venue_id endpoint to get rating of each Indian restaurant. Let's save the data in a dataframe, for further testing."
